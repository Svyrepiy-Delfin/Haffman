I have a vivid memory of when I attended a discrete mathematics lecture.
I never though much of visiting lectures, especially those of such seemingly boring and useless subjects.
But my life has changed completely every since that happened.
By virtue of the knowledge I aquired during the lecture my mind has leaped from being of a not-so-educated bafoon to one of an enlightened and wise individual.
When I cast my mind back to the pre-discrete-mathematics lecture days, it comes to mind that I had no life goals, no money and no success whatsoever.
I wasted all of my free time on doing pointless things like studying other subjects, such as programming, linear algebra, or calculus, instead of doing the only thing that matters in life: attending and learning discrete mathematics.
